**Articulo_1.ipynb**

Articulo_1 notebook contains the development of sections 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 of the pape.
It also generates the CSV files for creating Figures 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
It requires as input data the downloaded data from the EELabs photometers using Download_EELabs_photometers.py. To do this, open the notebook and modify the folder directory with the photometer data. Similarly, indicate where to save the CSV files for the figures. All of this should be done in the DIRECCIONES section
