# EELabs

This repository contains everything necessary for the development of the paper. It includes three main folders:

*Download_data: It contains the scripts for data downloads from both the EELabs photometers and the VIIRS

*Figures: It contains the scripts for creating the figures in the paper, many of which utilize data generated by the notebooks in the Notebooks folder

*Notebooks: It contains the paper notebooks, where data obtained from the Download_data files are processed to generate the values and Figures displayed in the paper. The figures data are saved as CSV files, and the results are displayed through print statements in the notebooks.
